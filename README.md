#Friendstration Event Log
- 2/18/2016: Added files from project we can modify project name later this is just what I had worked on. 
- 2/21/2016: Major Rehaul to interface courtesy of Suggestion :D 
- 2/28/2016: Uploaded Screenshots of all the Work-in-Progress Pages of the App, Horray! (Check Google Drive)
- 3/9/2016: Hello Programmers please refer to this readme.md for anything related to the development of the application.

# MAJOR UPDATE (2/21/2016 and now on)
- Use the "java/com/hipplo/mypc/friendstration" and "res" files on this Github as all other files are now irrelevant to the project code :D 
- Use this modified Android Manifest file to have our logo working on the emulator
- Suggest reworking your directory to match the files posted here so there is no id conflicts
- Make sure the files can be imported with all import libraries working 
- The Navigation Bar is working fully now in this version though it is currently linked to "empty pages"

#Instructions in Using Github
1. Consider what you want to edit (for example this file just click the file in the menu then click the edit button simple)
2. If you want to commit a change or create a seperate instance you should make an account with Github before preceding. 
3. Once you have an account, please make sure you upload in *your* branch as to not break any existing code
4. The Files you should upload are as listed under the "Presentation Files" and above this in the Major Update 
5. Once you have all those files copied upload to Github under that branch you made (example derdang_patch2) 
6. I will administer your edits and create a new "file" from the combination of all the groups work
7. If you still have an issue please email me your questions (perferrably with pictures) or give me a heads up during school
8. Thanks :D
