# Friendstration Deadlines
-March 6 Deadline to show Prototype

#Friendstration Event Log
- 2/18/2016: Added files from project we can modify project name later this is just what I had worked on. 
- 2/21/2016: Major Rehaul to interface courtesy of Suggestion :D 
- 2/28/2016: Uploaded Screenshots of all the Work-in-Progress Pages of the App, Horray! (Check Google Drive)

# MAJOR UPDATE (2/21/2016 and now on)
- Use the "java/com/hipplo/mypc/friendstration" and "res" files on this Github as all other files are now irrelevant to the project code :D 
- Use this modified Android Manifest file to have our logo working on the emulator
- Suggest reworking your directory to match the files posted here so there is no id conflicts
- Make sure the files can be imported with all import libraries working 
- The Navigation Bar is working fully now in this version though it is currently linked to "empty pages"
